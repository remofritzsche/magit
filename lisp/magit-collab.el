;;; Commentary:

;; This library implements various collaboration tools.  These tools
;; are only early incarnation -- implementing collaboration tools is
;; a top priority for future development.

;; Currently these tools (including `magit-branch-pull-request', which
;; is defined elsewhere) only support Github, but support for other
;; Git forges as well as mailing list based collaboration is in
;; planning.

;;; Code:

(require 'magit)
(require 'ghub)

;;; Commands

;;;###autoload
(defun magit-browse-pull-request (pr)
  "Visit pull-request PR using `browse-url'.

Currently this only supports Github, but that restriction will
be lifted eventually to support other Git forges."
  (interactive (list (magit-read-pull-request "Visit pull request")))
  (browse-url (format "https://github.com/%s/pull/%s"
